                Electric vehicle terminology can be overwhelming, especially when transitioning from traditional 
                petrol vehicles. Our comprehensive glossary translates complex technical concepts into practical 
                knowledge that directly impacts your buying decision and ownership experience in India.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>India-Specific Context:</strong> Every term in our glossary includes Indian market context. 
                When we explain "CCS charging," we mention that Tata and MG use this standard, while "CHAdeMO" 
                is rare in India. This localized approach helps you make decisions relevant to Indian infrastructure.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Practical Impact Focus:</strong> Rather than dry technical definitions, we explain how each 
                concept affects your daily usage. Understanding "regenerative braking" isn't just academic â€“ 
                it directly impacts your range in Bangalore traffic and reduces brake maintenance costs.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Government Policy Integration:</strong> We connect technical terms to Indian policies and 
                incentives. Terms like "FAME II subsidy" and "PLI scheme" are crucial for understanding the 
                total cost of EV ownership and available government benefits.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Emerging Technology Tracking:</strong> India's EV market evolves rapidly. We continuously 
                update our glossary with new terms like "battery swapping," "V2G technology," and "LFP batteries" 
                as they become relevant to Indian consumers, keeping you ahead of market trends.
